# Test Success Criteria for Edge Case Tests

This document defines the success criteria for the edge case tests implemented for the inlined-copy VS Code extension.

## 1. Special Character Path Resolution Tests

### Success Criteria:
- All test files with special characters in their names/paths must be correctly resolved
- The file resolver must handle spaces, hash (#), dollar ($), percent (%), and exclamation (!) characters in file paths
- Both relative and absolute paths with special characters must work correctly
- The extension must properly handle nested paths with special characters

### Metrics:
- 100% pass rate for all special character test cases
- No errors or warnings related to path resolution
- Consistent behavior across different special characters

## 2. Performance Tests

### Success Criteria:
- Single file expansion (100KB) must complete in under 1 second
- 10 file references must process with linear scaling (under 2 seconds)
- 50 file references must process with reasonable performance (under 5 seconds)
- Large file (5MB) must process in under 3 seconds

### Metrics:
- Processing time for each test case must be below the defined thresholds
- Memory usage must remain reasonable (no memory leaks)
- Performance degradation must be linear, not exponential, as file count increases

## 3. Circular Reference Tests

### Success Criteria:
- Self-references must be detected and reported as circular references
- Two-file circular references (A → B → A) must be detected
- Multi-file circular references (A → B → C → A) must be detected
- Appropriate error messages must be shown to the user

### Metrics:
- 100% detection rate for all circular reference patterns
- Proper error handling with clear error messages
- No infinite loops or stack overflows when processing circular references

## 4. Test Coverage Requirements

### Success Criteria:
- Unit tests must cover at least 80% of the code paths for file resolution and expansion
- Edge cases must be covered by both unit tests and manual test scripts
- All error conditions must have corresponding test cases

### Metrics:
- Code coverage percentage for each module
- Number of edge cases covered vs. identified
- Number of error conditions tested vs. possible

## 5. Manual Test Verification

### Success Criteria:
- Manual test scripts must run without errors
- Visual verification of special character handling must be possible
- Performance characteristics must be observable in real-world scenarios
- Circular reference handling must be demonstrable to users

### Metrics:
- Successful execution of all manual test scripts
- User feedback on clarity and usefulness of error messages
- Verification that real-world use cases are properly handled

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### Success Criteria:
- All test cases must be documented with clear descriptions
- Test results must be summarized in a report
- Any discovered issues must be documented with severity and impact
- Recommendations for improvements must be provided

### Metrics:
- Completeness of test documentation
- Clarity of test results report
- Actionability of recommendations
